# Fashion-Week-Outfit-Recommendation

### My Python assignment for the CFG Degree:

A Python console application designed to assist a fashion influencer navigating fashion week across various cities (London, Paris, Milan and New-York.
It's designed to recommend outfits based on the weather, making it easier for her to dress appropriately. She inputs the date and her current city, and the app generates outfit suggestions.
The app also stores her inputs and the corresponding recommendations for future reference in a text file.It's a helpful tool for a newcomer to fashion week events in unfamiliar cities.

* This is my first time building something with Python.
* This is the first time using an API.

### The Python code to fetch the API data and to generate the outfit recomendation can be found here:
